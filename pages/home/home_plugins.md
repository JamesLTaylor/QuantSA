# Introduction

QuantSA allows plug-in that may be required for several reasons such as:

* a user may require bespoke functionality that does not fit naturally into QuantSA.  
* a quant may have some proprietary models that they would like to sell to a particualr party and not make available to everyone
* a regular user of QuantSA write for themselves or commission a quant to write something specifically for them
