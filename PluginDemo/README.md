#QuantSA Plugins

Plugins in QuantSA have access to all the functonality in the core library and are themselves available to any of the valuation engines inside the core library.

The source code and proprietary models for the plugins do not need to be hosted on GitHub and can be completely privately developed and deployed only to selected QuantSA users.

For example, models developed inside a bank can be released only to users inside that bank but will appear alongside all the other QuantSA functionality.  The developers themselves control who gets the models and the main QuantSA project remains completely unaware of plugins that have been written.
