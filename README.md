# Website

# Vision
* To make an excel add-in that is freely available and quick and easy to use for common quant finance tasks in South Africa.  
* To have a solid quant libary that can be used in practice and education.
* For the library to be extensible so that more advanced developers and users can build private plug-ins to their own versions

# Motivation
To try and stop too many wheels from being invented.  

By making this open source everyone can use it and improve on it. By making it extensible, advanced users can build their own IP on top of it allowing them to focus only on the value adding development.
