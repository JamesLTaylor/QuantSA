# TestPermormance

This project exists for convenience.  It is set up with an example to call a test function in a console application so that the VisualStudio Community Edition Profiler can be run on that test.  To use it simply change which Unit test is created and called.

Changes should not be committed.

***If someone knows a way to profile unit tests without this then the project can be removed.***
