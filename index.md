  * Employee share scheme valuations.
  * BEE scheme valuations.
*  Have code that focuses on being easy to understand.
  * Will be used in teaching.
  * Allows users to quickly gain confidence in the implementation if they wish.
* Have an architecture that prefers scalability across extra hardware in preference to complex model implementations.
* Provide a backend with market data that is in the public domain
  * This is to enable a new user to perform a first valuation as soon as a product is captured.
* Have models that are standard and whose validation is done in the open by academics and practitioners.
* Allow plugins where sophisticated users can expose more advanced features alongside standard features.
