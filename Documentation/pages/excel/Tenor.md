## Description

When a QuantSA function requires a `Tenor` input the input needs to be an approriatly formatted string, with numbers and letters.

For example:

 * `3M` - 3 months
 * `1Y6M` - 1 year and 6 momths which would be exactly the same as `18M`

All allowed letters are:

 * `D` - days
 * `W` - weeks
 * `M` - months
 * `Y` - years
