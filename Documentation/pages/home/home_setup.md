## Github

QuantSA is written in C#.  It includes visual Studio 2015 solution files so the easiest way to get started is to open the solution in Visual Studio and begin writing.

* Download the source from <https://github.com/JamesLTaylor/QuantSA>
* Open `QuantSA.sln`
* Rebuild (Visual studio will sort out the project dependencies)

## Debugging with the Excel Add-in
* Set Excel as the startup project
 

## Running tests
* Each project comes with its own test project, find more details [here](/home_tests.html).
