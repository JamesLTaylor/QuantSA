## Excel users - Installer

Download and run the latest official installer from [Github releases](https://github.com/JamesLTaylor/QuantSA/releases).  (The latest unofficial installer is continuously updated [here](https://quantsa.blob.core.windows.net/builds/QuantSAInstaller_Latest.exe) )

A full listing of all past builds can be found at <https://quantsa.blob.core.windows.net/builds>

If all goes well QuantSA will be available to use next time you open Excel, if not then read the Zip section below for enabling the add-in.

## Excel users - Zip

If you don't have admin rights, don't trust the exe or want to be able to debug the source code; then download and extract a zip of the latest build folder from [Github releases](https://github.com/JamesLTaylor/QuantSA/releases) (The latest unofficial build is continuously updated [here](https://quantsa.blob.core.windows.net/builds/QuantSA_build_latest.zip))

Once you have extracted all the files, you will need to open excel and then: Addins -> Manage Excel Addins -> navigate to where QuantSA is installed and select QuantSA.xll.
